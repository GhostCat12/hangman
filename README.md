# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


### How it works!
1. Computer randomly chooses a word from a given word list
2. User inputs 1 alphabetical letter as a guess 
3. Computer runs checks to ensure input is valid and whether the guessed letter is inside the word.
